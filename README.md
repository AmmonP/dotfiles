# Dotfiles

Here lies all of my scripts/helpers/configurations for my shell environment, as well as Mac machine setup scripts. 

To configure and setup, clone this repo to `git clone https://github.com/AmmonP/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles` and then run `./setup.sh`. 

Example of what a `work` and `personal` gitconfig may look like

```

[user]
	name = YOUR NAME
	email = YOUR_PERSONAL_EMAIL@DOMAIN.TLD

# Specify the SSH key used with Git
[core]
    sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_personal

```
